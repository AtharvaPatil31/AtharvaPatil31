## Research Interests

My work explores the intersection of **mobile systems, human-computer interaction, and civic technology**. I'm particularly interested in:

- Scalable systems architecture for resource-constrained environments
- User-centered design for public infrastructure applications  
- Applied algorithms and data structures in real-world problem spaces
- Open-source software development and collaborative engineering

Currently building tools that bridge the gap between citizens and municipal governance, with a focus on accessibility and impact.

## Selected Projects

### [Civic Engagement Platform](https://github.com/Atharva-Patil/civic-platform)
**Flutter • Firebase • Google Cloud Platform • REST APIs**

A mobile-first platform enabling citizens to report and track municipal issues in real-time. Focuses on scalable backend architecture and intuitive UX design.

- Implemented geospatial indexing for efficient issue tracking across 100+ municipalities
- Designed RESTful API architecture handling 10K+ daily requests
- Built real-time notification system using Firebase Cloud Messaging
- Conducted user research with 200+ participants to optimize reporting flow

**Impact:** Deployed in 3 pilot cities, 5000+ active users, 15K+ issues reported

### [Algorithm Visualization Engine](https://github.com/Atharva-Patil/algo-viz)
**Python • Flutter • Custom Rendering Engine**

Interactive educational tool for visualizing complex algorithms and data structures. Designed to make CS education more accessible.

- Developed custom rendering engine for step-by-step algorithm execution
- Implemented 40+ classic algorithms (sorting, graph theory, dynamic programming)
- Built adaptive learning system tracking user comprehension patterns
- Published technical writeup on Medium (2K+ reads)

**Recognition:** Featured on Flutter Community Newsletter

---

### [Distributed Systems Experiments](https://github.com/Atharva-Patil/distributed-systems)
**Python • Docker • Kubernetes**

Personal exploration of distributed computing concepts through hands-on implementations.

- Built toy implementations of Raft consensus algorithm
- Experimented with consistent hashing and load balancing strategies
- Documented learnings on distributed databases and CAP theorem tradeoffs
